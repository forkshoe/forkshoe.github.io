  <p><strong>A Pain in the Molasses</strong></p>
<p>March 22 and 23, 2024</p>
<p>Mosesian Center for the Arts</p>
<p>One unseasonably warm day in January 1919, the large brown tank at 529 Commercial Street burst. A tidal wave of 2.3 million gallons of molasses tsunami-ed through the streets of Boston's North End, wiping out people, horses, and T stations. A Pain in the Molasses by Jael Whitney tells the fascinating tale of Boston's stickiest disaster. Full of puppets, music, dance, and historical accuracy, Fork &amp; Shoe's newest production is a cautionary tale about corporate greed and a testament to the power of the people. The show opened with a special performance of B Town Tunes from the Gosh Darn Brass Band.</p>
<p>The project was performed for groups of enthusiastic viewers. The MCA's black box was sold out all three performances.</p>

<p><strong>Blood Will Have Blood</strong>
OR: the many missteps of Macbeth and how we may prevent them</p>
<p>May 19 and 21, 2023</p>
<p>Performed at Turtle Swamp Brewing in May 2023, Blood Will Have Blood regales audiences with the story of a lucky (?) soldier whose choices lead to a cycle of violence after a prophecy of self improvement. He may remind you of a silly little man literary critics and theatre artists alike obsess over: Macbeth. Written in response to Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy, Blood Will Have Blood is a multimedia theatrical experience that asks: when the opportunity presents itself, what would you do for certain kinds of freedom, more control over your peers, financial stability, a better life? Who is a traitor and who is honest? Which of the two are justified? Is there a way out from the systems that pit us against each other?</p>
<p>Blood Will Have Blood was created as a thesis project by Rainier Pearl-Styles, utilizing devising techniques to deconstruct Shakespeare’s Macbeth, creating individual and community definitions of power.</p>
