  <h4>Blood Will Have Blood</h4>
<p>OR: the many missteps of Macbeth and how we may prevent them</p>
<p>May 19 and 21, 2023</p>
<p>Performed at Turtle Swamp Brewing in May 2023, Blood Will Have Blood regales audiences with the story of a lucky (?) soldier whose choices lead to a cycle of violence after a prophecy of self improvement. He may remind you of a silly little man literary critics and theatre artists alike obsess over: Macbeth. Written in response to Shakespeare’s shortest tragedy, Blood Will Have Blood is a multimedia theatrical experience that asks: when the opportunity presents itself, what would you do for certain kinds of freedom, more control over your peers, financial stability, a better life? Who is a traitor and who is honest? Which of the two are justified? Is there a way out from the systems that pit us against each other?</p>
<p>Blood Will Have Blood was created as a thesis project by Rainier Pearl-Styles, utilizing devising techniques to deconstruct Shakespeare’s Macbeth, creating individual and community definitions of power.</p>
